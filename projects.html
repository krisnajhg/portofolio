                  <h3>Challenges:</h3>

                  <p>
                    The waste disposal industry in Perth faces challenges in
                    providing an easily accessible, efficient, and user-friendly
                    skipbin booking solution. Traditional booking systems are
                    often cumbersome, require multiple manual steps, and are not
                    responsive to the needs of modern users.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Solution:</h3>

                  <p>
                    I developed a modern skipbin booking application using
                    Laravel Mix and Vue.js to address these challenges. The
                    application offers:

                      through the website or mobile app, eliminating the need to
                      contact a call center or fill out manual forms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Intuitive booking flow: The intuitive user interface
                      guides users through the booking process with clear and
                      easy-to-understand steps.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Advanced features: The application offers a range of
                      advanced features, such as a price calculator, order
                      status tracking, and secure payment options.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Responsive design: The application is designed to be
                      responsive and accessible across various devices,
                      including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                      fast, efficient, and scalable development, ensuring the
                      application can meet the evolving needs of the industry.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Improved operational efficiency: Automating the booking
                      and tracking process reduces staff workload and improves

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Increased revenue: The ease of booking and advanced
                      features encourage more customers to book skipbins,
