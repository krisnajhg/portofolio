                      <h3>Solution:</h3>

                      <p>
                        To address these challenges, I developed a robust
                        e-wallet mobile application using Flutter for the
                        frontend and Laravel with MySQL for the backend. The
                        application offers:

                          Intuitive user interface: Customers can effortlessly
                          manage transactions and account balances via a
                          user-friendly mobile app interface, reducing the
                          complexity of financial management tasks.

                        <li>
                          Secure transactions: Laravel's built-in security

                          that all financial transactions are protected,
                          maintaining user trust and data integrity.

                          across different platforms.

                          empowering users with comprehensive financial control.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </div>

                  <h3>Challenges:</h3>

                  <p>
                    The game industry faces challenges in delivering
                    engaging, educational, and user-friendly experiences for
                    teaching traffic signs. Traditional methods of teaching
                    traffic signs often lack interactivity and
                    real-world applicability, making it difficult for players
                    to retain information and apply it in real-life situations.

                  <h3>Challenges:</h3>

                  <p>
                    SMEs in Indonesia often face difficulties in reaching a
                    wider market and increasing online sales. Traditional
                    reseller platforms often have complex, inefficient
                    processes, and lack integration with secure and
                    user-friendly payment systems.

                  <h3>Challenges:</h3>

                  <p>
                    Traditional restaurant menus often face limitations in terms
                    of information, interactivity, and accessibility. Physical
                    menus can be cluttered, outdated, and difficult to maintain,
                    while digital menus on tablets or kiosks can be expensive
                    and impractical. Restaurants lacked a modern and
                    cost-effective solution to enhance their menus and improve
                    the dining experience.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Solution:</h3>

                  <p>
                    I spearheaded the development of QRMenu, a restaurant
                    application using Laravel, addressing these challenges and
                    revolutionizing the way restaurants present their menus.
                    This application empowers restaurants with:
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Digital and interactive menus: QRMenu provides a digital
                      and interactive menu accessible through QR codes,
                      eliminating the need for physical menus.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Rich menu content: Restaurants can showcase their menus
                      with high-quality images, detailed descriptions, and even
                      video demonstrations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Real-time menu updates: Menu changes are reflected
                      instantly on the digital menus, ensuring customers always
                      have the latest information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Seamless ordering system: QRMenu integrates a seamless
                      ordering system, allowing customers to place orders
                      directly from their smartphones.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Personalized dining experience: The application can

                    <li>
                      Increased customer engagement: Interactive menus and
                      personalized recommendations have led to increased
                      customer engagement and satisfaction.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Improved order accuracy: Direct ordering through the

                      efficiency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Enhanced staff efficiency: Staff can focus more on
                      customer service and less on managing physical menus and
                      orders.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Reduced operational costs: QRMenu eliminates the need for
                      physical menus, saving restaurants money on printing and
                      maintenance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Valuable customer data: The application provides valuable
                      customer data, enabling restaurants to gain insights into

                    QRMenu, the restaurant application I developed using

                    menus, interact with customers, and manage their operations.

                    Astramotor Bali, a leading motorcycle dealership in
                    Indonesia, faced the challenge of manually entering daily
                    shipment data, a time-consuming and error-prone process that
                    hindered operational efficiency and data accuracy. The
                    existing system lacked automation and was susceptible to
                    human error, leading to discrepancies and delays in shipment
                    processing.
